## üöÄ **Vision: Frictionless Godhood**

RimAI Framework introduces a paradigm shift in colony management through **"frictionless interaction"** - eliminating the need for colonists to gather at specific locations or interrupt their work for administrative tasks. Power is exercised through a centralized **"Imperial Overseer Terminal"** using asynchronous, broadcast-style commands.

Your decisions become "divine decrees" that silently influence the world without disrupting colony productivity. Consequences manifest through colonist thoughts, dialogue bubbles, social logs, and global messages, creating a seamless and supremely efficient governance experience.

## üìê **Three-Tier Architecture**

To create a clear and extensible ecosystem, the RimAI project is organized into three distinct layers:

### 1. **Framework Layer** (This Repository)
- **Purpose**: Pure technical backend and communication layer
- **Responsibilities**:
  - All Large Language Model (LLM) network communication
  - API key management, request building, response parsing, and error handling
  - Core data structures and interfaces (`ToolDef`, `CaseDef`, `IContextProvider`, etc.)
  - Extensible UI containers (terminals, windows)
- **Goal**: Absolutely neutral, stable, and efficient. Contains no gameplay logic.

### 2. **Core Gameplay Modules** (Future Repositories)
- **Purpose**: Official content packages that define core game experiences
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Concrete game systems like "Judicial System" and "Colony Chronicles"
  - Specific case types, AI tools, and game event listeners via XML and C#
  - UI population for player interaction interfaces
- **Analogy**: Like RimWorld's "Core" content, with potential for independent "DLC" modules

### 3. **AI Storyteller** (Future Integration)
- **Purpose**: Master of game pacing and randomness
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Standard RimWorld `StorytellerDef` implementation
  - Periodic AI analysis of colony state
  - Dynamic event generation based on AI insights
- **Goal**: Truly unpredictable, logic-driven narrative experiences

## üéØ **Core Features**

### Imperial Overseer Terminal
- **Single Point of Power**: One buildable core structure unlocks the entire RimAI system
- **Integrated UI**: Multi-tabbed terminal interface for different administrative tasks:
  - **Case Files**: Handle criminal cases and civil disputes in dossier format
  - **Imperial Codex**: Issue global administrative decrees and permanent laws
  - **Cabinet**: Appoint and manage your advisory officials
  - **Colony Archives**: Access historical records and statistics
  - **W.I.F.E. System**: Warden's Integrated Foresight Engine - your AI advisory council

### Asynchronous Governance
- **Case Logging**: Crimes and disputes automatically create timestamped cases with deadlines
- **Dossier Review**: Handle cases at your convenience through parchment-style interfaces
- **Judgment Delivery**: Issue decisions in natural language with optional reasoning
- **Magistrate Delegation**: Unhandled cases are automatically processed by appointed officials
- **Broadcast Consequences**: Results propagate through thoughts, social changes, and ambient reactions

### Officer System
- **Magistrate**: Handles overdue cases and reports back through letters
- **Steward**: Provides administrative suggestions based on colony state
- **Speaker**: Proposes legislative improvements based on recent events

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### Core Technologies
- **Harmony**: Event-driven architecture and runtime code injection
- **ThingComp**: Component system for object-specific data and behavior
- **GameComponent**: Global data management and persistent storage
- **Custom Defs**: New XML-definable concepts (`ToolDef`, `CaseDef`)
- **ModSettings**: Player-configurable options and API management

### Key Classes
- `LLMManager`: Singleton for all AI communication
- `RimAISettings`: Configuration management and persistence
- `ContextManager`: Game state analysis and context building
- `CoreDefs`: Framework-level definitions and data structures
