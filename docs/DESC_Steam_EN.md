🤖 **RimAI Framework** - AI-Powered RimWorld Experience

🔧 **Core Framework Module**
RimAI Framework is the foundational core of the entire RimAI ecosystem, bringing revolutionary artificial intelligence experiences to RimWorld. This framework handles all communication with Large Language Models (LLMs) and provides comprehensive API interfaces for other content modules.

⚡ **Key Features**
• 🌐 Seamless integration with multiple Large Language Models
• 🔌 Unified API interface for other RimAI modules
• ⚙️ Highly optimized performance and stability
• 🛡️ Secure and reliable AI communication protocols
• 🔄 Asynchronous processing and real-time response support
• 🏠 **Full support for local OpenAI-compatible APIs** (Ollama, vLLM, etc.)

🔑 **IMPORTANT: Setup Required Before Use**

⚠️ **You MUST configure the mod settings before use!**

**Step-by-Step Setup Guide:**
1. **Enable the mod** and restart RimWorld
2. **Go to Settings → Mod Settings → RimAI Framework**
3. **Fill in the following fields:**

   � **API Key** (Required for most services):
   • OpenAI: Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   • Local Ollama, vLLM: Leave empty (no key needed)
   • Copy and paste your key exactly as provided

   � **Endpoint URL** (Required):
   • OpenAI users: https://api.openai.com/v1
     (Deepseek, Siliconflow settings are similar)
   • Local Ollama users: http://localhost:11434/v1
   • For other services: Check your provider's documentation

   🤖 **Model Name** (Required):
   • OpenAI: `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`
   • Ollama: `llama3.2:3b`, `qwen2.5:7b`, `mistral:7b` (your installed model)
   • Enter the exact model name as specified by your provider

   🔄 **Enable Streaming** (Optional):
   • ✅ Check this box for real-time responses (recommended)
   • ❌ Uncheck for single complete responses

4. **Test the connection** using the test button in settings
5. **Save settings** and you're ready to go!

💡 **Quick Start Recommendations:**
• **Free option**: Install Ollama locally with `llama3.2:3b` model
• **Paid option**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (very affordable, ~$0.15 per 1M tokens)
• **Budget option**: Use Deepseek or Siliconflow for cost-effective solutions

💰 **Important Cost Notice**
⚠️ **Token costs are paid directly to your AI service provider, NOT to the mod author!**
• For cloud services (OpenAI, Deepseek, etc.): You pay per token usage
• For local deployments (Ollama, vLLM, etc.): No additional costs after setup
• The mod author receives no payment from your API usage

🏠 **Local AI Support**
✅ **Fully supports local OpenAI-compatible APIs:**
• Ollama (recommended for local deployment)
• vLLM
• Text-generation-webui
• LocalAI
• Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
